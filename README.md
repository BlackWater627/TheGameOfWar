TheGameOfWar
============

A simple PHP app to demonstrate logic and Object-Oriented PHP coding.

FLOWCHARTS
Logic not restricted by specific languages can be found in the flowchart directory.
Simple JPGs for easy viewing.

INSTALL AND RUN
This mini app consists of only two classes and a few lines of code to run it.
You only need a PHP server to run. No setup or building is required.
Simply use git clone to stick it in a serving directory such as htdocs or public_html.
To run, go to the directory root (index.php should run by default).
For example, on a dev server: http://localhost/TheGameOfWar/

FORMATTING
The app's output uses HTML formatting. This can, of course, be stripped out if so desired.

FILE WRITING
If you so desire, the app can produce the results of the game in a basic HTML file.
Just uncomment the lines at the bottom of the PHP file.
