TheGameOfWar
============

A simple PHP app to demonstrate logic and Object-Oriented PHP coding.

WHAT DOES THIS MINI APP DO?

Ever played a card game called War? Two players each have one half of a shuffled deck and they play cards against each other to win those cards from each other. You can look up the game elsewhere to get the detailed rules. Basically, what happens during a game of War is great for demonstrating programming logic. When run, this app will output information on six rounds of War and also output what cards end up in each player's card pile.

FLOWCHARTS

Logic not restricted by specific languages can be found in the flowchart directory.

INSTALL AND RUN

This mini app consists of only two classes and a few lines of code to run it.
You only need a PHP server to run. No setup or building is required.
Simply use git clone to stick it in a serving directory such as htdocs or public_html.
To run, go to the directory root (index.php should run by default).
For example, on a dev server: http://localhost/TheGameOfWar/

FORMATTING

The app's output uses HTML formatting. This can, of course, be stripped out if so desired.

FILE WRITING

If you so desire, the app can produce the results of the game in a basic HTML file.
Just uncomment the lines at the bottom of the PHP file.
